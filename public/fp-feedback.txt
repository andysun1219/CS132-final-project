Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?
My estimated grade for the Final Project is roughly around 95. I worked with a partner and
I think the workload distribution was fair.

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
My estimated grade for the course is an A. Based on already released grades, my estimated
grade should be around an A. I believe all of my assignments met all requirements and
were completed with care. In addition, I attended most lectures and feel that I consistently
learned and improved my assignments using lecture, lecture notes, and assignment feedback.

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?
Feedback on my styling and design would be helpful. 

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
Since I am a graduating senior, I did not implement the cart view.

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?
Yes. Anonymous.
