Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?
TODO

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
TODO

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?
TODO

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
TODO

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?
